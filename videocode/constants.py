    imported — the normal path is the import-time read of VC_SCREEN above,
    which needs no rebinding at all. This exists for the one case that can't
    take that path: the visual-regression suite renders scenes of different
    sizes in a single interpreter.

    rebinding of a global can change it. So a template whose default depends
    on the world box must not spell it as a literal default — it takes `None`

      side-by-side at 16x9, stacked at 9x16, without touching the scene. In a

    is measured in — where its pattern is centred and what one pattern-unit
    is worth. Resolved in C++ by `resolveEffectParams`, the one place that
    knows a mesh's real extents.

    - `SHAPE` (default): the host shape's own box, every frame. The pattern
      moves and scales WITH its host, so a growing shape magnifies the
      pattern instead of resampling it. This is what every other paint in
      the repo already does (gradients project in local mesh space, textures
      default to `UVMapping.STRETCH`) and what Manim does, where colour data
      rides the mobject's points.
    - `FRAME`: the whole frame. The host becomes a window onto a
      frame-wide pattern — move the shape and it slides over a fixed
      pattern, like a torch beam.
    - `ANCHOR`: the host's box FROZEN at the frame the fill was assigned
      (`Metadata::fillShaderSince`, the same instant that already freezes
      the paint's clock). The pattern stays pinned where it was, so a
      growing shape UNCOVERS it. Re-derived from that declared frame, never
      remembered from render history — so it survives hot-reload and
      preview scrubbing.
    - `GROUP`: the union of every host sharing this paint instance — one
      nebula across a whole `Text` instead of one per letter (assigning one
      `starNest()` to a `Text` broadcasts that instance to every letter).

    Rotation is not followed in any mode yet; the shape's box is an AABB.
