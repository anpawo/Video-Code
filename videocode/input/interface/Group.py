    A member as it stood when the group was formed.

    `width` and `height` are frozen here for the same reason the position is:

    pivot that moves while it is being used. `Group.width` reads
    `inp.meta.position` of its members, so once a rotation has started moving
    them, the box the pivot is sampled from is the box the rotation has already
    produced — the transform derives its centre from its own result.

    Measured on `Group(Group(a, b), c).rotateBy(90)`: the outer pivot went from
    (0.25, 0) before the animation to (0.50, 0) after, and `_emitRigid` asks for
    it on every emission.

    #: Zero for a leaf, whose position IS a location.
    #:
    #: A group is not AT its `meta.position`: that field is a displacement it
    #: adds to members it holds around its own pivot, so zero means "wherever
    #: they already are", not the origin. Reading it as a location made a

    #: 1 / 0.707 / 1.581 apart when they had started 1 / 1 / 2.
    #:
    #: So the base position of a member group is its pivot plus that

    #: number rather than a branch: "leaf or group?" was asked at every
