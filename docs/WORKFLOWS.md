# What guards the repo

Three places, split by what each can actually decide. Nothing blocks a push.

| where | what it checks | when | blocks? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GitHub Actions** | types, the suites, docs/test coverage of new API, qmllint, formatting, the build, the C++ unit tests, the QML chrome, `eg.py` still renders, the bake digest | every push and PR | the run goes red, the push already landed |
| **`make check`** | visual regression, C++ unit tests, bake digest, performance — and RECORDS the timings into `test/perf/history.jsonl` | when you ask for it | no |
| **`/ship`** | writes the docs, tests and examples a change owes | before committing | no |
| `.githooks/pre-commit` | what the repo forgot to commit, coverage, types, the QML chrome (~15 s) — armed with `make arm` | on commit, once armed | yes |

## The board

One page says what is happening, so nobody has to ask:
**https://claude.ai/code/artifact/a80200f9-2f71-48e8-b59e-7a8d6353e3ca**

Its source is `docs/board.html`. Edit that file and publish it to the same URL.
Five sections, colour-coded and fixed: **Needs your check** (orange, the only
one that asks something of a person), **In progress** (blue), **To do** (green,
split by what BLOCKS each group rather than by theme), **Won't do** (red, with
the reason in the right-hand column — that column is the point of the section),
**Shipped** (with the commit's short SHA).

Update it as the state changes, not at the end of a session: a board that is
right once a day is a board someone has to ask about. Hold ⌘ and hover a row for
its three-bullet detail, which lives in that row's `data-b`.

`docs/FEATURES_TODO.md` is the long form of the same information — measurements,
numbers, designs that were rejected and why. The board is the view; that file is
the record. Keep them agreeing.

## GitHub does the waiting

The `fast` job of `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` runs the suites and pyright. It
also runs `test/coverage_check.py --pushed`, which reads every public symbol the
pushed range adds to the library (`videocode/`, `src/`, `include/`) and asks:

- is there a docstring where it is defined?
- is it mentioned in `docs/*.md`?
- is it mentioned in `test/`?

For C++ it reads headers only: a type declared in a `.cpp` is reachable by
nobody, so it is not surface. Asking a function-local helper for a documentation
page is a false alarm, and a false alarm on a hook is how a team learns to type
`--no-verify`.

It never writes anything, and it greps for names — so it cannot see a docstring
that lies or a test that asserts nothing. It is the floor, not the ceiling. When
it goes red, run `/ship` and push again. A deliberate exception is fine: say why
in the commit message.

The build job now renders `eg.py` too. That file is the living showcase of every
feature worth seeing, so if it stops rendering, an example in the docs has gone
stale — which is the failure mode documentation actually has.

## One rule, one place

Two of the defects this repository was audited for were a rule written twice
whose copies agreed by coincidence. `Context.channelKey` is the answer to *what
name does this piece of state answer to*: `Args:<name>` for an `args` shader,
the class name for everything else. It is asked by `Context.apply`, which
stores a frame under that key, and by `Input.apply`, which decides from it
whether two statements are rivals. Had those two ever drifted apart, the editor
would have warned about the wrong pairs while the stack stored under a
different name, and nothing would have said so. `test/contention_test.py`
asserts that they agree — not that either is right on its own, which is the
part a single-sided test would have missed.

## Done (2026-09-01): the pivot was a query, and is now a value

A council of six seats (2026-08-31, `~/.claude/councils/2026-08-31-videocode-semantique-groupes/`)
compared Manim, After Effects, Blender, Figma/SVG, Lottie and glTF against this
repository. Its conclusion, and the reason it is written here rather than acted
on: **the redesign is decided, the urgency is not.**

**What is wrong.** `Group._pivot(align)` is a function of `(content, align)`
re-evaluated at read time. There is no way for an author to place the point by
hand — `videocode/shader/vertexShader/` has no `pivot`, no `anchor`, no
`about_point`, and `align(x, y)` is itself a fraction of the derived bounding
box. Every other engine on the table lets the author answer that question;
this one only lets them ask it. So the code is stuck between two measured
failures:

| | measured |
|---|---|
| pivot frozen (today, `_MemberBase._snapshot`) | a group transform overwrites a member's own animation — **29 frames of 30**, silently, and it hits a plain leaf exactly as hard as a nested group |
| pivot live (sampling restored) | `Group(Group(a,b),c).rotateBy(90)` → **58 distinct pivots**, formation diverging by **~960×** over 30 frames |

**What was done, in this order.** Item 1 is the one that mattered; the rest
followed from it and were cosmetic on their own. All five landed on
2026-09-01, each byte-identical on the corpus except item 4, which changed
nothing there either — the three single-frame collisions counted below turned
out to compose to the same numbers.

1. **An author-placed pivot.** `about_point` on `rotate`/`scale`, plus a named
   granularity for `Text` in the shape of After Effects' `Anchor Point
   Grouping` (Character / Word / Line / All) — a `Letter` has no downstream
   identity to parent to, so its pivot has to be a rule the engine resolves at
   emission. This one retires the `isinstance` tests **and** the freeze **and**
   the re-emission.
2. `_MemberBase.parentInverse: v2`, zero for a leaf, replacing
   `pivot: maybe[v2]`. This is Blender's `matrix_parent_inverse`: a stored
   correction rather than a branch. Measured byte-identical on 49/49 scenes and
   43/43 test files — free, and **cosmetic if done alone**.
3. The emitted frame carries a pivot resolved to a number, never a
   `_pivot(align)` re-read.
4. Compose a member's timeline with the group's instead of overwriting it.
   Closes the whole class. The large piece.
5. Name the axis *placed vs composite* in the code — a `Group` has
   `meta.index is None` and never reaches `Context.stack`, and that, not the
   pivot, is what makes it a different kind of thing.

**Why it had been postponed.** Zero animations were actually lost anywhere in
the 55-scene corpus: the three real channel collisions are single-frame
placements a parent legitimately replaced. The defect was reproducible in three
lines and had bitten nobody. Item 1 changes the public API and deserved to be
decided when someone needed it, not because a council named it. That decision
was reversed on 2026-09-01 and the five items were done in order.

**Item 2 was never done on its own.** It passes every gate while teaching the
codebase that groups and leaves are the same kind of thing, which is the one
conclusion the council rejected — item 1 landed before it, and item 5 named the
axis that does separate them: `placed` vs `composite`, a slot in the stack
rather than a pivot.

**What the API gained.** `rotateTo`/`rotateBy`/`scaleTo`/`scaleBy` take
`about=v2(x, y)`; `Text.anchor` takes `Anchor.CHARACTER | WORD | LINE | ALL`,
After Effects' Anchor Point Grouping, resolved at emission because a `Letter`
has nothing an author could hold. `test/pivot_about_test.py` and
`test/group_defect_test.py` hold both ends.

## What GitHub cannot check, and why

**Visual regression.** The goldens in `test/visual/golden/` were rendered on
Apple Silicon through Metal. The CI runner has no GPU and falls back to software
Vulkan (`mesa-vulkan-drivers`), whose antialiasing differs — every scene would
fail, for reasons that have nothing to do with the change. Comparing pixels
means comparing them against the same renderer.

**Performance.** A shared runner's timings, on software rendering, say nothing
about a baseline measured on this machine — measured, the runner renders at
589 ms/frame against ~8 ms here, which is a different rasterizer rather than a
noisier one. So the split is: **this machine measures, GitHub remembers.**
`make check` appends one line per commit to `test/perf/history.jsonl`, which
travels in the commit like a golden, and the `history` job publishes the curve
without ever running a benchmark. What CI *can* compute exactly is what the
scenes ASK the renderer to do — `test/perf/digest.py`, a per-scene hash of the
bake, held to zero tolerance on any runner.

A threshold on wall time would either never
fire or fire constantly.

Both live in `make check` instead:

```bash
make check
```

- **Visual** — renders every scene in `test/visual/scenes/` and compares against
  its golden. Only failures *not* listed in `test/visual/known_failures.txt`
  count, so "already broken" is never mistaken for "broken just now".
- **Performance** — `test/perf/guard.py` re-runs the benchmark and compares
  against `test/perf/baseline.json`: load time (+30 % tolerated), render speed
  (+20 %), total wall time (+20 %), peak memory (+25 %). Timings keep the best
  of three runs; the mean drags in whatever else the laptop was doing.

Never run a blanket `--update-golden` to make a suite green. A golden can be
recording a bug: the `matte` golden did exactly that on 2026-07-28, blessing a
word whose letters were mis-spaced. Look at the image, decide whether the new
render is right, and regenerate that one scene alone.

Re-baselining performance is a decision, not a chore:

```bash
python3 test/perf/guard.py --update
```

Do it when a change makes the renderer legitimately slower (a feature worth its
cost) or legitimately faster (then the new floor protects the win), and say
which in the commit message. `docs/optimization.md` records how the current
numbers were earned — start there before accepting a regression.

## `/ship` — the half a script cannot do

CI decides whether a change is *allowed* in. The skill makes it *worth* letting
in: it reads the diff, writes the missing docstrings, the `docs/*.md` entries and
the tests, adds a **runnable** example for each, and checks whether the
surrounding documentation went stale — a wrong doc is worse than a missing one,
because it is trusted.

Deterministic checks block; judgement writes. Keeping them apart is why nothing
on your critical path is slow.

## The optional local hook

If you would rather catch the coverage debt before pushing than read it off a
red CI run:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks     # arms .githooks/pre-commit (~12 s)
git config --unset core.hooksPath       # disarms it
```

It runs the coverage check only — types and tests stay on GitHub, and nothing
gated to a push. `git commit --no-verify` bypasses it once.
