## Getting Started
To create a video with Video-Code, you need to write some simple code in Python.

The flow of the Video comes from the __Inputs__ that you, first create, then modify with __Transformations__ and finally add to the __timeline__.

To create an __Input__, use one the methods created according to what you need, it can be a __video__, an __image__ or a __text__, etc...<br>
To modify it, you need to use __Transformations__ like __moveTo__ or __scale__.<br>
To add the frames of the __Input__ to the timeline, use the __\<Input\>.add()__ function.
