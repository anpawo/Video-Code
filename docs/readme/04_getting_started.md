## Getting Started with Video-Code
To create a video with Video-Code, you need to write some simple code in Python.

The flow of the Video comes from the __Inputs__ that you, first import or create, then modify with __Transformations__ and finally add to the __timeline__.

To import or create an __Input__, you need to create a __video__, __image__ or a __text__ instance (soon shapes).<br>
To modify it, you need to use __Transformations__ like __translate__ or __fade__.<br>
To add the frames of the __Input__ to the timeline, use the __\<Input\>.add()__ function.
