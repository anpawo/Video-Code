# Video-Code
The initial goal of this project is to create videos from code.<br>
I've always wanted to create millimetric videos and I will be able to, soon enough.

The second thought is that such thing can be used to automate the generation of video.<br>
AI have a hard time with designs, they are better with code, they could potentially take advantage of this project to generate videos with a good quality and a logical flow.

Thirdly, I want the program to have a visual interface like any other video editing app but I want it to be automatically generated from the Python API.<br>
With a code and a visual interface, anyone can make videos according to their liking.

## Getting Started with Video-Code
To create a video with Video-Code, you need to write some simple code in Python.

The flow of the Video comes from the __Inputs__ that you, first import or create, then modify with __Transformations__ and finally add to the __timeline__.

To import or create an __Input__, you need to create a __video__ or __image__ instance (soon text and shapes).<br>
To modify it, you need to use __Transformations__ like __translate__ or __fade__.<br>
To add the frames of the __Input__ to the timeline, use the __\<Input\>.add()__ function.

Below is an example of the last feature added (code) and the result (video).
