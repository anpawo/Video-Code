// Every colour and metric the chrome uses, in one place — the same palette the
// zoning mockup (docs/ui/editor.html) reasons about, so the two cannot drift.
//
// The rules behind the numbers, worth keeping when you edit them:
//   · One hue per media kind, all four kept cool, so the warm accent always
//     wins: the playhead has to be the most urgent thing on screen.
//   · An effect never borrows its host's hue — it takes the complement, because
//     an effect is something DONE to a medium, not a second smaller medium.
